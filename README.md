Displays the result in percentage.

Warns if the calculated efficiency is unrealistic (greater than 100% or less than 0%).

Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

Notes
Built with Kivy (Python GUI framework).
Designed for quick demonstration and learning purposes.
The code only provides the basic UI and calculation logic — styling and advanced error handling can be added if needed.
